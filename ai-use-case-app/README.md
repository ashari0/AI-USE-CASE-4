# Test description

    These unit tests are designed to verify the correct operation of a form component in React. The primary focus of these tests is to validate user input. We check the main functional requirements for the form: name validation, verification of the correctness of the e-mail address, agreement with the terms of use and the user's choice of gender.

    The main purpose of the tests is to check whether the form has been sent to the backend. The form is sent only if it is filled out correctly; otherwise, the request to the backend will not be made.
